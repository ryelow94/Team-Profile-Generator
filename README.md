# Team-Profile-Generator 

## Description : 
### This app allows the user to create a profile for each team member. When the user answers a series of questions in the terminal, then the app develops an html page with a card for each team member. The app will create one team manager, and as many engineers and/or interns as required by the user. Furthermore, the app provides a test to make sure each function is working properly and is going to provide accurate information about the team member in question. 

## Usage: 
### This app requires the user to install "inquirer" in order to prompt the questions and "jest" in order to run the tests.
